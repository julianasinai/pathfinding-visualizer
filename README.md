# Pathfinding Visualizer

Graph search algorithms can be complex, this application allows one to visualize the different exploration patterns they perform. See a demo at https://dazzling-benz-245716.netlify.app/


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Work in progress

I intend to add more algorithms and alter the animation effects.
